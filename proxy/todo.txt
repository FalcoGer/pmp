Do:
- command to toggle notifications

- allow starting proxies from CLI
    command create name remotehost localport remoteport
    make sure name doesn't exist already

- allow stopping proxies from CLI
    command kill [name] - if name empty, kill current and select first
    make sure either always 1 active or some form of fallback is in place if no proxies exist

- make core parser core only (no proxies required)
  derive base parser from core parser with base functionality with proxies
  derive custom parsers from that base parser, those are reloaded

- add multi parser support
    load from files, reload them smartly (when file changed)
    reload them even if currently selected proxy doesn't use them
    command loadparser filename
- make a better check for when to reload the Parser module in application.py

- allow running of scripts from file
    command run file

- allow renaming of proxies
    command rename [newName]
    make sure to also update the name attribute in the proxy itself
    make sure to adjust the keys in all relevant dictionaries
      d[newKey] = d.pop(oldKey)
    make sure that a proxy with that name doesn't exist already

- allow selecting proxies by remote host and port

- move the proxy into it's own repo and make it a submodule here
    REF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17413493/create-a-submodule-repository-from-a-folder-and-keep-its-git-commit-history
- make internal variables and functions private with _
    provide getters and setters with proper checks


Fix:
- Latest command not part of history
- clearhistory <id> not working
- pack/unpack c_string and pascal_string not working right
