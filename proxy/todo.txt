Do:
- make a better check for when to reload the Parser module in application.py
- command to toggle notifications
- allow starting proxies from CLI
- allow stopping proxies from CLI
- allow running of scripts from file
- allow naming of proxies & selecting by name as well as ID
- allow selecting proxies by remote host and port
- move the proxy into it's own repo and make it a submodule here
    REF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17413493/create-a-submodule-repository-from-a-folder-and-keep-its-git-commit-history
- re-add typing to function parameters via included module names as namespace (application.proxy instead of importing proxy again)

Fix:
- Latest command not part of history
- clearhistory <id> not working
- pack/unpack c_string and pascal_string not working right
